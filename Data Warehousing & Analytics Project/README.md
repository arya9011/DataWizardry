# Water Quality Data Warehousing Project

Overview
--------
This project focuses on building a Data Warehouse for analyzing water quality measurements from the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in England. The dataset includes water samples collected from various sources between 2000 and 2016 for environmental monitoring and compliance assessments.

Project Highlights
------------------
Designed a Star Schema with Fact & Dimension Tables for efficient querying.
ETL Process – Extracted data from Microsoft Access, cleaned and transformed it, and loaded it into an Oracle Database.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removed missing values, standardized attributes, and improved data consistency.
SQL-Based Analysis – Developed queries to track water quality trends, pollution levels, and sampling frequency.
Python-Oracle Integration – Used cx_Oracle and pandas for data extraction and reporting.

Technologies Used
-----------------
Database & ETL: Oracle, Microsoft Access, SQL
Data Processing: Python (pandas, cx_Oracle)
Data Warehousing: Star Schema, Fact & Dimension Tables
