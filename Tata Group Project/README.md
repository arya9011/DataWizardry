# Online Retail Data Analysis Project

Overview
--------
This project is focused on analyzing an online retail dataset with the goal of extracting actionable insights and understanding key aspects of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The analysis was performed using Tableau and Python, where various summary statistics and visualizations were used to understand and explore the data.

Purpose of the Project
----------------------
> Analyze sales and customer data to uncover insights that can help improve business decision-making.
> Identify patterns in sales by product, customer, and region.
> Understand customer behavior in terms of product preferences, purchase frequency, and sales volume.
> Visualize data to make it easier to understand and present insights to stakeholders.

Scope of the Project
--------------------
> Sales performance across different product lines and countries.
> Customer analysis, focusing on repeat purchases and total spending.
> Time-based analysis, identifying seasonal sales trends and peak purchase periods.

Project Goals
-------------
> Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform statistical analysis and visualize key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and top-performing products.
> Customer Insights: Identify key customer segments and behaviors using customer purchase patterns and frequencies.
> Sales Trends: Analyze sales trends over time, identifying peak seasons and trends across regions and products.
> Visualization: Create a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to provide a clear overview of the findings and support decision-making.

Success Criteria
----------------
> Quality of Insights: The insights gained should be actionable and meaningful for business decisions, such as product recommendations or targeted marketing campaigns.
> Data Quality: The dataset should be thoroughly cleaned, with missing values, duplicates, and outliers appropriately handled.
> Clarity and Usability: The Tableau dashboard and Python visualizations should be easy to interpret and should clearly communicate the finding.

Tools Used
----------
> Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation.
> Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, analysis, and statistical calculations.

Key Findings
------------
> Top Product Lines: The analysis showed that certain product lines consistently performed better in specific regions, while others had more seasonal sales.
> Customer Segmentation: The analysis helped identify high-value customers who made repeated purchases, which could be targeted for loyalty programs.
> Sales Trends: The dataset revealed that sales spiked during specific periods, with Q4 showing the highest revenue, suggesting a strong holiday season effect.
